### **✨ Your Smart Plug Demo in Dark Mode**

The **real magic** happens when you test your smart plug in dark mode:

#### **Smart Plug OFF (Dark Mode)**
- **Elegant dark glass cards** floating above gradient background
- **Subtle shadows** that enhance depth
- **Crisp white text** for perfect readability

#### **Smart Plug ON (Dark Mode)** 
- **Intense red glowing auras** around Coca-Cola parts! 🔥
- **Dramatic contrast** between dark background and red glow
- **Professional manufacturing aesthetic**

#### **Hover Effects (Dark Mode)**
- **Cards lift** with enhanced dark shadows
- **Glow intensifies** for active conditional parts
- **Smooth 60fps animations** throughout

## Theme Toggle Features

### **🎛️ Smart Toggle Interface**

The theme toggle shows:
- **Visual indicator** (🌙 for dark, ☀️ for light)
- **Current mode name** ("Dark Mode" / "Light Mode")
- **Animated switch** with smooth transitions
- **Theme previews** showing what each mode looks like

### **🎨 Theme Previews**

Each theme shows mini card previews:
- **Light theme preview**: Clean white cards with subtle shadows
- **Dark theme preview**: Dark glass cards with enhanced shadows
- **Conditional effect previews**: Shows how red effects look in each theme

### **💡 Smart Descriptions**

Dynamic descriptions change based on current theme:
- **Dark mode**: "🌙 Dark mode reduces eye strain and provides better contrast for conditional effects"
- **Light mode**: "☀️ Light mode offers crisp visibility and clean appearance for detailed part inspection"

## The Technical Magic

### **🚀 Automatic Theme Application**

The theme system uses CSS custom properties that update in real-time:
```css
--inventree-bg-primary: [theme.primaryBackground]
--inventree-bg-card: [theme.cardBackground]
--inventree-text-primary: [theme.primaryText]
--inventree-shadow: [theme.shadowColor]
--inventree-gradient: [theme.backgroundGradient]
```

### **🔄 Seamless Transitions**

All components automatically inherit theme changes:
- **CellRenderer**: Cards adapt to new colors instantly
- **TableLayout**: Grid background follows theme
- **LayoutPreview**: Editor preview matches main view
- **Conditional Effects**: Glows work perfectly in both themes

### **💾 Smart Persistence**

```typescript
// Theme persists across sessions
localStorage.setItem('inventree-card-theme', themeMode);

// Automatic initialization
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('inventree-card-theme') || 'light';
```
